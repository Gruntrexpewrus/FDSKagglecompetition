# FDSKagglecompetition
Here we develop our code to *win* a kaggle competition of 2018(so...not win anymore)<br>
The competition is about predicting future payment behavior of clients from application, demographic and historical credit behavior data. We have provided the data in the raw form (instead of aggregations of time variant data on loan level we provided the underlying data needed for such aggregation) as we are keen to not only see what modelling approaches will the Kaggle community use but also how will the community work with the data in such form. Will the best solution be complete black-box with only minimal feature engineering/learning? Or will some smart feature engineering/learning help “crack the case”? To help you create some interesting features we have prepared file with description of every column (please refer to “HomeCreditcolumnsdescription.csv” file in the data section).
